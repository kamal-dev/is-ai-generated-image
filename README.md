# :bulb: Image classification: Is the image AI generated or Real? :camera: :clapper: :scroll:

### :label: Project Setup
 - Install the required libraries from requirements.txt 

### :label: Algorithm
- For this image classification problem Alexnet CNN architecture has been used.

### Future Scope of Work

This image classification can be better optimized and enhanced to reduce the validation loss. This can be achieved using ImageDataGenerator (Currently couldn't do due to lack of resource). The val_loss can be even reduced further by increasing the number of data set.
